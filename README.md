# 👋 Hi, I’m Bhavin Shekhada (@bhavinshekhada)

- 👀 **I’m interested in:**  
  Digital VLSI design, physical design, ASIC development, FPGA programming, and hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL. My passion lies in working on the hardware-software interface, with a strong focus on optimizing circuits and systems for performance and efficiency.

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:**  
  Advanced VLSI design techniques, chip design flow, and in-depth concepts of computer architecture. I'm also honing my skills in embedded systems and scripting language.

- 💻 **What you can find in my GitHub:**  
  Projects utilizing Verilog for FPGA and ASIC design, covering methods such as sequential and combinational logic, finite state machines, and memory design.
  
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  
  Projects that push the boundaries of VLSI design, especially in the areas of low-power design, high-performance computation, and hardware accelerators. I’m also interested in contributing to open-source projects related to FPGA development and ASIC prototyping.

- 📫 **How to reach me:**  
  You can reach me via email at [Gmail](bhavinshekhada03@gamil.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavin-shekhada-224715246/).

- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I enjoy diving deep into the world of digital circuits, but when I’m not coding or designing, you’ll probably find me exploring the latest tech in the gaming and sports!
